<p>Satan is the protagonist and anti-hero of Book I of Paradise Lost. Let us start using the facial guidelines to begin drawing in Satans face. Romeo and Juliet may be the last place you would look for a literary inspiration for Satan and I dont think it was one for Milton we cant completely rule out the possibility but I think we can safely agree it is considerably less likely than England winning the World Cup. Be sure to sketch. He and his followers were cast out of heaven and down to hell. Pin By Moonchild On Aes Dark Art Drawings Satan Drawing Satanic Art.</p>
