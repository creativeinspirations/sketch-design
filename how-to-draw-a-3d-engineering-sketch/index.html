<p><strong>How To Draw A 3d Engineering Sketch</strong>, SOLIDWORKS includes a 3D sketch tool to make the process of creating geometry that snakes or slides through 3D dimensions. Just like its 2D counterpart the 3D sketch tool creates geometry by using points lines splines and any other sketchable shape to define a profile. This is especially true for the engineer.</p>
